          <strong>Network-based Multi-level Module Construction and Terrain Knowledge Mapping in Glioblastoma Patient-Derived Xenograft (GBM PDX). </strong><br />
          I aim to develop a technique to explore the abnormal functions in the radiation resistance or/and temozolomide resistance and screen the potential drugs to eventually increase the survival rate.<br />

          <strong>Pathway, Annotated-list, and Gene-signatures Electronic Repository Version 3 (PAGER 3).</strong><br />        
		  In PAGER 3, I aim to provide a major update on data sources and develop a new enrichment algorithm so that PAGER can overcome incomplete data and a lack of precise evaluation in the typical enrichment analysis such as over-represented analysis.

          <strong>The network-based epidemic model in simulating the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2</strong><br />      
		  In this project, I plan to develop a network-based SEIDR model (N-SEIDR), which will significantly improve the accuracy of the simulation by reducing errors generated from the traditional SEIR model.
