          <strong>G-thinker: A Subgraph-Centric Distributed Framework for Mining Subgraphs, UAB
</strong><br />
          Sep, 2017 - Present<br />
          G-thinker, for subgraph mining, which (1) provides a subgraph-centric programming model natural for subgraph mining, and (2) atruly compute-intensive execution engine. G-thinker is significantly faster and more scalable than existing systems and fills the gap of efficient distributed subgraph mining.<br />
          My Responsibility: graph mining application development, experiments, load balance analysis<br />

          <strong>Roadway Design Safety Evaluation Using 8DOF Driving Simulator, Tongji University</strong><br />
          Mar, 2016 - May,2016          (co-advised by Prof. Andrew P. Tarko from Purdue University)<br />
          Analyzed road alignment data (slopes and curvature) and figure out models reflecting the relations between road alignment and road safety.<br />
          My Responsibility: data preparation for feature extraction, and model training and comparison. (C++)<br />

          <strong>Shanghai Traffic Safety Management System Development, Tongji University</strong><br />
          Dec, 2015 - June, 2017<br />
          Built a real-time traffic data analytic system, including:<br />
            - prediction of crash probability for every section of Shanghai highway.<br />
            - real-time traffic volume of every section of Shanghai highway through analyzing loop detector traffic data.<br />
            -prediction of the urban road length affected by crashes. (under study)<br />
          My Responsibility: built an incremental traffic crash classification model<br />

          <strong>Highly Consumable Business Analytics System, Tongji University.</strong><br />
          May, 2015 - Sep, 2016 <br />
           This system provides an online platform to process model training for users having no professional knowledge of data mining. <br />
          My Responsibility: website backend (Java), data mining engine at backend (R language)<br />
